I created a simple division program that runs in a loop so the user can keep trying as many times as they want. Each time through the loop, the program asks for two numbers, then sends those inputs to my Divide method. That method tries to convert the inputs into integers and perform the division. If the user types something that isn’t a number, tries to divide by zero, or enters a number that’s too big or too small, the program catches the error and explains exactly what went wrong. After each attempt, the user gets the choice to try again or exit. The whole thing is designed to be clean, user‑friendly, and easy to follow
